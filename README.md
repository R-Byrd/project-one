Project Proposal: Analysis of Netflix TV Shows and Movies Dataset

I. Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of Netflix TV shows and movies to discern trends in popularity and the factors influencing cancellations. As the streaming wars intensify, understanding these dynamics is crucial for strategic decisions in content creation, marketing, and platform management. This analysis will help identify what characteristics contribute to a show's success or failure and predict future trends in viewer preferences.

II. Problem Statement

Netflix releases hundreds of titles each year, but not all succeed. While some become cultural phenomena, others are quietly canceled after a few seasons or even a single season. By examining historical data, this project aims to uncover patterns in popularity and cancellations, providing insights that could help optimize content offerings and marketing strategies.

Next class we will pull the data and begin to manipulate it.




This class period we reviewed our data and came up with a plan for visualizations as well as who is presenting what and when. We plan to put the final touches on our visualizations and slides throughout the day tomorrow and gather as early as possible to finalize. Only 2 crying breaks were taken during this session


Analysis of Top 5 TV Show Genres (2019-2021)

The focus was to analyze the top 5 TV show genres within a 3 year period of pre and post-covid years, specifically from 2019 to 2021, based on the number of seasons each produced. Here are the key findings. 

Crime TV and Kids TV 
Both genres tied for the highest number of seasons, each producing 268 seasons in total within the three year span
Crime TV had a significantly higher number of shows with only one season (159) compared to Kids TV (35). 
Netflix Production 
 Netflix produced an average of 240 seasons annually between 2019 and 2021. 
Out of these, approximately 101 shows did not produce more than one season
Season Analysis 
53% of the shows in 2019 and 202 produced only one season
In 2021, this percentage spiked to 82%. 
Yearly Breakdown:
2019: 53% of shows had only one season.
2020: 53% of shows had only one season.
2021: 82% of shows had only one season.


Observations & Insights

Production Strategy: Despite high cancellation rates, Netflix should continue producing a high number of shows, as more than half of the shows end after one season. 
Impact of External Factors: The drastic drop in the number of shows produced from 2022 to 2023 can be attributed to reasons like writers' strikes, layoffs, and production budget cuts.

These findings suggest that the number of seasons produced does not directly correlate with the continuation or cancellation of shows. Netflix appears to benefit from producing a high number of shows, despite over 50% of them ending after 1 season.
