Project Proposal: Analysis of Netflix TV Shows and Movies Dataset

I. Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of Netflix TV shows and movies to discern trends in popularity and the factors influencing cancellations. As the streaming wars intensify, understanding these dynamics is crucial for strategic decisions in content creation, marketing, and platform management. This analysis will help identify what characteristics contribute to a show's success or failure and predict future trends in viewer preferences.

II. Problem Statement

Netflix releases hundreds of titles each year, but not all succeed. While some become cultural phenomena, others are quietly canceled after a few seasons or even a single season. By examining historical data, this project aims to uncover patterns in popularity and cancellations, providing insights that could help optimize content offerings and marketing strategies.

Next class we will pull the data and begin to manipulate it.




This class period we reviewed our data and came up with a plan for visualizations as well as who is presenting what and when. We plan to put the final touches on our visualizations and slides throughout the day tomorrow and gather as early as possible to finalize. Only 2 crying breaks were taken during this session
